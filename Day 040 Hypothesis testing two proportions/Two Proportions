                                                                       Two Proportions
                                               
                                               Consider people in cities and people in villages and find the number
                                               of people who speak english in each location.
                                               
                                               Null Hypothesis : p1 - p2 = 0
                                               i.e no. of people who speak english from both places are the same.
                                               
                                               Ha : p1 - p2 != 0
                                               alpha = 10%
                                               
                                               Lets say we take a same of 247 people from villages and 91 speak english.
                                               Now lets say we take 308 people from cities and 120 speak english,
                                               
                                               p^ = (91 + 120)/(308 + 247) = 0.38
                                               
                                               247(0.38) = 94
                                               308(0.38) = 117
                                               247*(1-0.38) = 153
                                               308 * (1-0.38) = 191
                                               
                                               all are greater than 10.
                                               
                                               p^1 = 91/247 = 0.37
                                               p^2 = 120/308 = 0.39
                                               
                                               p^ = p^1 - p^2 = -0.02
                                               
                                               (Best Estimate - Hypothesized estimate)/ Standard error
                                               (p1^ - p2^ - (p1 - p2))/std error
                                               std error = root(p^(1-p^)(1/n1 + 1/n2)
                                               
                                               we get p-value of 0.63 and since 0.63>0.1 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
