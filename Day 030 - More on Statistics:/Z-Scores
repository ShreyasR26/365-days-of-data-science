          Z-Scores:
          
          A Z-score is the number of standard deviations removed from the mean.
          Z-Scores are often used to standardize values.
          
          Formula to compute Z-scores:
          (xi - mu)/(standard deviation)
          where xi is the desired value.
          
          Make a Z-scores table for all values in the distribution.
          In a normal distribution, 68% of the data lies in the first standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the data lies within the 2nd standard deviation of the mean.
          
          Z-scores tell us how extreme an observation is,
          More positive Z-scores means, data is skewed towards the right and more negative Z-scores means data is skewed towards the left.
          
          Sum of all z-scores is always 0.
          
          Z-score of 1.72 means the particual value is 1.72 standard deviations away from the mean.
          Z-score of 0.8 means the particual value is 0.8 standard deviations away from the mean and thus this value is more common than the one where we got 1.72.
