                                          One proportion:
                                          x + t* s/root(n)
                                          
                                          Where t is the statistic from 't' distribution, s is sample sd and x is sample mean.
                                          
                                          Two Proportion:
                                          xd + t* sd/root(n)
                                          Take Sd and sample mean difference between the two variables,
                                          for example, checking education level for twins.
