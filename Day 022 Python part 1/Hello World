                                                                    
                  Hello World                                                      
                                                                        
1. print("Hello, World!")
             
2. Python Indendation:
     
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
  
  
3. Python Comments
Use # to write a comment

"""
To write comments in more than 1 line.
"""

4. Python Variables
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

x = "Sally"

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)

5. Python Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

x = str("Hello World")	str	
x = int(20)	int	
x = float(20.5)	float	
x = complex(1j)	complex	
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	list	
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	tuple	
x = range(6)	range	
x = dict(name="John", age=36)	dict	
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	set	
x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	frozenset	
x = bool(5)	bool	
x = bytes(5)	bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	bytearray	


x = memoryview(bytes(5))	memoryview
