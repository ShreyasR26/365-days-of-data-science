                                                                                   Distributions
                                                                                   
                                 1. Histograms
                                   A histogram is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights. 
                                   In a histogram, each bar groups numbers into ranges. 
                                   Taller bars show that more data falls in that range. 
                                   A histogram displays the shape and spread of continuous sample data.
                                 
                                   Note: Check Figure 1.1 : Histogram
                                 
                                   It is best to keep a moderate amount of bins in a histogram, too low would result
                                   in a diagram without much information and too high would result in a clustered diagram.
                                 
                                 2. Distribution
                                    A distribution is essentially a histogram in a curve. 
                                    Note: Check Figure 1.2 : Distribution in Histogram
                                          Check Figure 1.3 : Distribution
                                    
                                    Distributions deal with adding outliers better. Distributions with smaller standard deviations
                                    are usually bigger whereas distributions with larger standard deviations are smaller.
                                    
                                    Note: Check Figure 1.4 : Comparing Distributions
                                   
                                  3. Normal Distribution
                                      A normal distribution or a bell curve is a distribution where 95% of the data lies within
                                      2 standard deviations of the mean.
                                      
                                      Note: Check Figure 1.5 : Normal Distributions
                                    
                                      We can calcuate the probability of a certain even under the bell curve by taking the required 
                                      area under the curve. We need the mean and standard deviation of the dataset to draw the bell curve.
                                      
                                   4. Population Parameters
                                       A population is a distinct group of individuals, whether that group comprises a nation or a group of people with a common characteristic. 
                                       In statistics, a population is the pool of individuals from which a statistical sample is drawn for a study. 
                                       Thus, any selection of individuals grouped together by a common feature can be said to be a population.
                                       
                                       A sample is a statistically significant portion of a population, not an entire population. 
                                       For this reason, a statistical analysis of a sample must report the approximate standard deviation, or standard error, 
                                       of its results from the entire population. Only an analysis of an entire population would have no standard error.
                                       
                                       The population parameters for a normal distribution are mean and standard deviation.
                                       Population parameters change according to the distribution.
                                       
                                       Taking this in a machine learning persective, a sample is like the training data and the curve is what we obtain after
                                       training the model.
