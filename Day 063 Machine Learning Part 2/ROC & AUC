ROC (Region of Convergence) shows True positive rate, it is used to find the best threshold in order to minimize false positives and negatives.

True positive rate or sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

False positive rate or specificity = False Positives / (False Positives + True Negatives)

In figure 63.2, (0,0) is the point of no false values, (1,1) is the point of all Sensitivity = Specificity

AUC is used to compare multiple ROCs.

Higher the AUC, better the ROC.
