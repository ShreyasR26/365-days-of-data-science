                                                                  Everything on statistics is on Sampling
                                              
                                              A sample is a smaller amount of the population to do a statistical analysis.
                                              We use descriptive and inferential statistics.
                                              
                                     Sample : We need a good representation of a sample, i.e which sample can get a good estimate of the whole population.
                                     Note: Bigger sample is usually better, especially if it's random.
                                     Larger the sample, the higher likelihood of getting a normal distribution.
                                     This is called sampling distribution of the sample mean.
                                     
                                     Central Limit Theorem:
                                     The sampling distribution of the sample mean provided the sample is large enough is approximately a normal distribution.
                                     Large enough sample: 30
                                     
                                     (sigma)x^ = (sigma)/root(n)
                                     
                                     '(sigma)x^' is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.
                                     sigma is the sd of population.
