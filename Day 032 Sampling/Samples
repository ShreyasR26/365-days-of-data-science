                                              A sample is a smaller amount of the population to do a statistical analysis.
                                              We use descriptive and inferential statistics.
                                              
                                     Sample : We need a good representation of a sample, i.e which sample can get a good estimate of the whole population.
                                     Note: Bigger sample is usually better, especially if it's random
