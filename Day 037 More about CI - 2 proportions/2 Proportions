                                                                                Two Proportions
                                                                                
                                       Consider 2 subjects, maths and english, 37% of students took english and 53% took maths.
                                       
                                       To find the difference between the two, 
                                       
                                       p1^ - p2^ +- (Margin of error)
                                       Margin of error is the sum of both standard errors (Error always add up.)
                                       
                                       The number of people who take maths are 13% - 24% higher than those who took english.
                                       
                                       Assumptions:
                                       1. Both events are idependent
                                       2. Sample size is large enough.
