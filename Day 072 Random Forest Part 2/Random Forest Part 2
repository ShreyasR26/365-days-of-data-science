                                                                            Random Forest 
                                                                            
                        For missing values,
                        For categorical, take the mode.
                        For numeric, take median/mean
                        
                        To refine these guesses, have a look at similarities.
                        
                        Step 1:
                        Build a random forest
                        
                        Step 2:
                        Build all of the data on all of the trees.
                        Check a Proximity matrix after every tree.
                        Have a look at the data ending up on the same leaf nodes.
                        
                        We can also use proximity matrix & MDS plot
