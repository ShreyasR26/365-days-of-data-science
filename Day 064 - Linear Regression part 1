                                                                         Linear Regression
                                                                         
  Predict mouse size using mouse weight.
  
  Take all the data points on a graph and draw a horizontal line between all the data points. Measure the distance between the points and the line, this distance is called the residual.
  Fig 64.1 Residuals
  
  Now rotate the line to about 60 degrees, and measure the residuals and square and sum them.
  
  Now rotate the line again, and repeat the process.
  
  Now plot a graph for all the different sum of residuals and choose the lowest point in the data.
  Fig 64.2 residuls plot.
  
  Take R2 and find sum of squares using least squared fit.
  
  SS(fit) = (data - line)^2
  
  Var(fit) = (data - line)^2/n
  
  R2 tells us how much variation in mouse size can be explained by taking mouse weight into account.
  
  R2 = (Var(mean) - Var(fit))/(Var(mean))
  
  R2 = 0.6 means there is a 60% reduction in variance of mouse size if we take mouse weight into account
