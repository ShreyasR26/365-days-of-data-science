                                                                              Hypothesis Testing
                                                                              
                                   Lets say we are making a drug to cure a "certain" virus. Let there be 2 drugs A and B,
                                   Lets say A on average takes 12 hrs to recover and B on average takes 15 hrs to recover.
                                   We can now call our hypothesis,"A can recover a patient faster than B".
                                   
                                   Check Figure 4.1 A vs B
                                   
                                   Now continue the tests on different samples and we realize the B on average takes less time
                                   to recover than A does. Do this again and again, and we see that B still takes less time than A.
                                   
                                   Check Figure 4.2 Multiple Testing
                                   Check Figure 4.3 Double Checking
                                   
                                   Now we can therefore, reject the hypothesis.
                                   
                                   Now take 2 drugs C and D. C on average takes 12 hrs to cure and D on average takes 15 hrs to cure.
                                   Now we can call our hypothesis "C can recover a patient faster than D".
                                   
                                   After multiple tries, we find that the time varies, but overall C recovers a patient faster than D.
                                   Therefore, we can "fail to reject the hypothesis".
                                   
                                   Check Figure 4.4 Confirming Hypothesis
                                   
                                   If the tests are completly different from the hypothesis, we can reject the hypothesis, but if the 
                                   tests aren't different enough from the hypothesis, then we can only fail to reject the hypothesis.
                                   Note: Fail to reject often happens due to randomness.
                                   
                                                                   Null Hypothesis
                                                                   
                                   Consider drug E and drug F and lets say we take a hypothesis saying drug E takes about the same time to recover as
                                   drug F. Then, we test on a large sample size and either reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis. 
                                   Note: Null Hypothesis is taken before any testing.
                                   
                                                                    Alternative Hypothesis
                                    
                                    We run a statistical test, for that, we need 1. Data 2. A null hypothesis 3. An alternative Hypothesis
                                    In this case, the alternative hypothesis is simply the opposite of the null hypothesis.
                                    
                                    Note: We can't always fully accept an alternative hypothesis because there might be an alternate to that as well
                                    we can reject a null hypothesis in favour of an alternative hypothesis.
