                                                                           Decision Trees
                                                                           
              Decision tree is basically a yes-no question.
              Classification here can be categorical or numberical
              
              Terminologies:
              Root Node/Root: Nodes/ Decision points that have no arrows pointing towards them, but have arrows pointing away.
              Nodes/Internal Nodes: Intermediate nodes have arrow pointing towards and away
              Leaf Nodes: Arrow pointing towards but none pointing away
              
              Now, to predict whether a patient has heart disease.
              
              Dependent variable: Heart Disease
              Independent variables : Chest pain, blood circulation, blocked arteries (all Yes/No)
              
              Now take all independent variables and classify with heart disease.
              
              Check Fig 69.3
              Impurity:
              Since none of the leaf nodes are 100% 'Yes' or 100% 'No', all leave are impure.
              
              We can use Gini Index to measure gini index
              gini = 1-(probability of yes)^2 - (probability of no)^2
              
              Example: take chest pain
              Leaf 1 : Heart disease: Yes  for  105, no for 39 -> 144
              Leaf 2: Heart disease : Yes for 34, no for 125 -> 159
              1 - (105/(105+39))^2 - (39/(105+39))^2 = 0.395
              
              Leaf 2 : 0.336
              We take weighted averages to measure gini impurity to account in differences in sample sizes both leaves.
              (144/(144+159))*0.395 + (159/(159+144))*0.336
              = 0.364
              
              Therefore gini impurity for Chest pain is 0.364
              
              gini impurity for blood circulation: 0.36
              gini impurity for blocked arteries : 0.381
              
              blood circulation has lowest impurity, so use that as root node
              
              Do this for each node
              
              Now try for weight vs heart disease
              Separate using differnt weights (Fig 69.4 167.5,185,205 etc)
              Find the least gini impurity (205)
              
              Now we know to calculate gini categorical and numeric data
