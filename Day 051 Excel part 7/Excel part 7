                                                                Operation order:

                                                         Formulas -> Formula auditing -> Evaluate Formula
                                                         
                                                         Excel functions:
                                                         all excel functions start with '=',
                                                         
                                                         Note: All excel functions have '()', whether
                                                         they have arguments or not.
                                                         
                                                         Eg: =NOW(), =TODAY() , =PI()
                                                         
                                                    Functions can operate on a single cell or a range of cells.
                                                    =max(F1:F8) or sqrt(16)
                                                    
                                                    combin(4,2) gives total number of combinations, 4C2 = 6
                                                    Counta -> counting categorical variables
                                                    
                                                    We can round up or even truncate functions.
                                                    
                                                    CHOOSE Function is used to map integers with corresponding values.
