                                                                           Opening a File
                                                                           
                                  handle = open(filename,mode)
                                  mode can be read or write ('r' or 'w')
                                  
                                  counting lines in a file
                                  
                                  count = 0
                                  for line in fhand:
                                     count += 1
                                  print(count)
                                  
                                  .read() reads everything as 1 line
                                  
                                   Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, 
                                   and print the contents of the file in upper case. Use the file words.txt to produce the output below.
                                   
                                   fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
fh_read=fh.read()
print(fh_read.upper().rstrip())

Lists

A list is a group of variables or constants
s = ['a','b','c']
t = [1,2,3]
u = [1,[2,3],4]

looping through a list
for i in s:
  print(i)
  
  Manipulating Lists
  Manipulating lists is very similar to manipulating strings
  s[2:4]
  s[:4]
  
  stuff = list()
  stuff.append('book')
  stuff.append(99)
  
  sort the list using list.sort()
  
  str = 'Anything is Possible'
  str.strip()
  print(len(str))
  3
  
  Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method. 
  The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list.
  When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.
  fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
lst = list()
for line in fh:
    line_split=line.split()
    for words in line_split:
        if words not in lst:
            lst.append(words)
lst.sort()
print(lst)
