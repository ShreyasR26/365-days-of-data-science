                                                                   Testing Population Mean with confidence
                                                                   
                                        Step 1: Define Null and alternate hypothesis and set significance level -> usually 5%
                                                Example: Take hypothesis mean say H0 = 80 and Ha> 80.
                                        Step 2: Examine results and check summary. We can take the sample mean as 82.48, which
                                                may not be significantly greater than H0. To find out whether this is significant,
                                                find standard error of sample mean. sigma/root(n)
                                                Now check test statistic, t:
                                                t = (best estimate -  null value)/ estimated std error = (x^ - 80)/(s/(root(n))
                                                t = (82.48 - 80)/15.06/(root(25)) = 0.82
                                                
                                                Therefore sample mean is only 0.82 standard deviations away from the mean.
                                                
                                        Step 3: Determine p-value
                                                Now test the t=0.82 assuming null hypothesis is true, if it is true, t-statistic follows
                                                Student-t distribution, degrees of freedom = n-1 = 25-1 = 24.
                                                degrees of freedom determine how thick the ends are.
                                                p-value = 0.21
                                                
                                        Step 4: Making a decision
                                                We fail to reject the null hypothesis as p>0.05.
                                        Step 5: Tie into range of 90% CI.
