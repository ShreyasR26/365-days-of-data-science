                                                The probability of a certain section in a normal distribution is the area under the 
                                                curve for that section divided by the total area under the curve.
                                                
                                                Likelihood are y-axis values in a normal distribution for a distinct point
                                                on the x-axis.
                                                
                                                Eg: Likelihood of getting the mean of a distribution is pretty high

                                                Suppose we have the heights of lions, and we find a way to spread this data in a
                                                normal distribution, to find the center of this distribution, we find the likelihood
                                                of various points (individual lions), then we plot a graph for the various likelihoods

                                                From this, we can find maximum likelihood estimates for the mean. We can do the same
                                                for standard deviation.

                                                 An exponential distribution is a distribution that models time between events.
                                                 
                                                 y = lambda (e^(-lambda*x))
                                                 lambda is the rate parameter. If lambda = 1, this event happens once a second.
                                                 x1 is the time passed between 1st and 2nd event.
                                                 x2 is the time passed between 2nd and 3rd event.
