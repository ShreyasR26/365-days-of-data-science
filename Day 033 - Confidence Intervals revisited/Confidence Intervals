                                                                                 CI for mean
                                                                                 
                                               Revise CI from previous lectures.
                                               
                                               CI =
                                                x^ +- 1.96(sigma)x
                                                (sigma)x = (sigma)/root(n)
                                      The mean is the population parameter, and the CI states that the probability of obtaining the population
                                      parameter from the sample is 95%.
                                      In other words take n number of samples and 95% of the population contains population mean.
                                      
                                      Note: At times we need to estimate the standard deviation in order to compute the population mean.
                                      
                                      To estimate sigma, we can use the T-distribution as opposed to a normal distribution.
                                      
                                      1.96 is the Z-score for the 95% CI.
                                      
                                      CI = x^ +- 1.96(estimated sigma)x
                                      this estimation may contain an error, therefore we can use a T-distribution x^ = t95%(estimated sd).
                                      
                                                     CI for proportion and Confidence levels
