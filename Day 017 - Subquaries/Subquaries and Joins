 SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, 
based on a related column between them.

Examples:
1.Using a subquery, find the names of all the tracks for the album "Californication".
select tracks.name
from tracks left join albums
on tracks.albumid = albums.albumid
where albums.title = 'Californication'

2. Find the total number of invoices for each customer along with the customer's full name, city and email.
select count(c.invoiceid), c.firstname, c.lastname, c.email
from (select *
      from invoices left join customers
      on invoices.customerid = customers.customerid) as c
groupby c.lastname

3. Retrieve the track name, album, artistID, and trackID for all the albums.
select tracks.name, albums.artistid,tracks.trackid,albums.title
from albums left join tracks
where tracks.trackid = 12

4. Retrieve a list with the managers last name, and the last name of the employees who report to him or her.
select a.LastName as EmployeeLast,a.ReportsTo,b.LastName as ManagerLast
from Employees as a
left join Employees as b
on a.ReportsTo=b.EmployeeId

5. Find the name and ID of the artists who do not have albums. 
select a.Name,count(a.Name)
from
(select Artists.ArtistId,Artists.Name,Albums.AlbumId
from Artists
left join Albums
on Artists.ArtistId=Albums.ArtistId
where Albums.AlbumId is null) as a
group by a.Name
order by count(a.Name) asc

6. Use a UNION to create a list of all the employee's and customer's first names and last names ordered by the last name in descending order.
select FirstName, LastName from Employees
union
select FirstName,LastName from Customers
order by LastName desc

7. See if there are any customers who have a different city listed in their billing city versus their customer city.
select *
from (select *
      from customers left join invoices
      on customers.customerid = invoices.customerid) as c
where c.billingcity <> c.city
