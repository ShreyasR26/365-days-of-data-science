                          A histogram is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights. 
                          In a histogram, each bar groups numbers into ranges. 
                          Taller bars show that more data falls in that range. 
                          A histogram displays the shape and spread of continuous sample data.

                                                              What are distributions?
                                    
                           In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives 
                           the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment. 
                           It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events.
                           A distribution is essentially a histogram with a curve. The advantage here is that it is easier to add outliers to a 
                           distribution rather than a histogram.

                           The more higher the graph, the lower the standard deviation and vice versa.

                                                                 The Normal Distribution
                                                                 
                            A normal distribution, sometimes called the bell curve, is a distribution that occurs naturally in many situations.
                            In a normal distribution, 95% of the data lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean. To calculate the probability in
                            a normal distribution, we need the area under the curve for the probability we want and the total area under the curve.
                            The two parameters needed in a normal distribution are the mean and the standard deviation. Different distributtions requires
                            different parameters.

                                                               Population Parameters
                            
                            A population includes all members from a specified group, all possible outcomes or measurements that are of interest. 
                            he exact population will depend on the scope of the study. 
                            For example, say you would like to know whether there is an association between job performance 
                            and the amount of home working hours per week in the specific case of Belgian data scientists. 
                            In this case, the population might be Belgian data scientists. 
                            However, if the scope of the study is more narrow 
                            (e.g., the study focuses on french-speaking Belgian data scientists who live at least 30km away from their workplace), 
                            then the population will be more specific and include only workers who meet the criteria. 
                            The point is that the population should only include people to whom the results will apply.
