Wildcards and the LIKE operator

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
 The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character
 
 SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';
