                                                                  There are two types of mean:
                                                                  1. Exact mean
                                                                  2. Estimated mean
                                                                  
                                                      The estimated mean is used more often because the sample is usually too large to
                                                      calculate the exact mean. The estimated mean (or expected mean) is calculated from 
                                                      the normal distribution. The x-axis of the highest point in the distribution is
                                                      the mean of the population.

                                                                               Variance
                                                      Variance is calculated by:
                                                           var = sum(x-mu)^2/n, where n is the sample
                                                           
                                                           for expected variance,
                                                           var = sum(x-*x)^2/n-1
                                                           
                                                           n-1 is used because of possible decrease in the sum, due to the expected mean
                                                           and not exact mean.
                                                           
                                                     We calculate standard deviation because in variance, we square all numbers so as to not
                                                     get negative numbers. Dividing by n may under estimate the variance.
                                                     SD = root(var)

                                                     Taking different values for the mean, we can plot a graph of varince vs mean and see that the lowest point 
                                                     for variance i.e the mean is the lower in the case of expected mean. i.e the sum(individual variance).

                                                     Take the derivate at the smallest point (0) and find the estimated average, since derivative is used to find the
                                                     minima, we have sum(x-X)/(n-1) < sum(x-mu)/n.
