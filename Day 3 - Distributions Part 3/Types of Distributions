                                                                             or continuous.
                                                            We can pick up a random sample from a population.
                                                            Eg: Outcome of coin toss 
                                                         PMF corresponds to a probability that a random variable takes a value.
                                                         PMF >= 0
                                                         Sum of PMFs should be 1.
                                                         
                                                         The PMF corresponds to a discrete random variable.
                                                         The Probability Density Function (PDF) corresponds to a continuous random variable.

                                                         P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|A^)*P(B))
