1. If, elif, else statement:

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
  
  2. Conditional If
  a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")
  
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")
  
3. Nested If
 x = 41

if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")
    
 4. Pass Statement
(to avoid pass)
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
  
  
5. While loop
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  
The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

Example
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
  
The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
  
  The else Statement
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

Example
Print a message once the condition is false:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
  
  
5. For Loops

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  
  Looping Through a String
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
  
  The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break
   
 The range() Function
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

Example
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
  
  or
  for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)
  
  Nested Loops:
  adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
